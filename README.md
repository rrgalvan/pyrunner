# PyRunner

Python library for running programs or interpreted scripts.


The tarjet is to capture the output to console produced by the
program, for further post-processing, for instance plotting, using
Jupyter widgets...

See for instance this [Jupyter notebook example](./pyrunner_keller-segel.ipynb) where
the [FreeFEM++](http://www.freefem.org/) language and interpreter is used for solving
a partial differential system (Keller-Segel model, then the output is filtered
and data obtained is post-processed.
